2. **Clone the repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:slavik-pastushenko/tokenomics-simulator-rs.git
    ```

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your changes using the following command:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
    ```

4. **Make your changes**: Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.

5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message using the following command:

    ```

7. **Create a pull request**: Go to the original repository and click the `New pull request` button. Select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes. Submit the pull request for review.

### Building the engine

To build the engine, run the following command:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Testing the engine

To run the tests, use:

```sh
cargo test
```

### Code Quality Checks

Run [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) to lint the code:

```sh
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features --no-deps -- -D warnings
```

Run [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to format the code:

```sh
cargo fmt
```

### Documentation

Generate documentation in HTML format:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

### Benchmarks

You can run benchmarks locally for the changes you have made to the engine.
The engine uses [Criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) as its benchmarking tool.

To run a benchmark against the changes you have made, for example, you can run;

```sh
cd benches

# Run all benchmarks.
cargo bench

# Run all tests in the `benches/engine_bench.rs` file
cargo bench --bench engine_bench

# After running benches, you can check the statistics under `target/criterion`
```

## Examples

We encourage contributors to create examples that demonstrate the features of the `tokenomics-simulator` crate. Examples help users understand how to use the crate and provide practical use cases.

### Creating an Example

1. **Create a new example file**: Add a new file in the examples directory with a descriptive name, such as `examples/my_feature_example.rs`.

2. **Write the example code**: Write the code that demonstrates the feature. Ensure that the code is well-documented and includes comments explaining each step.

3. **Test the example**: Run the example to ensure it works as expected using the following command:

    ```sh
    cargo run --example my_feature_example
    ```

4. **Submit a pull request**: Follow the steps in the `Submitting Pull Requests` section to submit your example.

### Running Examples

To run an example, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run --example example_name
```

Replace `example_name` with the name of the example file (without the `.rs` extension).
